ROAM - Real-time Optimally Adapting Meshes
==========================================

This was a project originally worked on by Adam Brykajlo and Jon Holmes for a 
course in Geometric Modeling. It is a non-working implementation of ROAM which 
is a Level Of Detail (LOD) algorithm for rendering terrains in real-time.

I, Adam Brykajlo, am continuing work on the project to see it's completion and
continue learning about computer graphics.
